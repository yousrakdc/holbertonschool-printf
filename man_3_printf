PRINTF(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                            PRINTF(3)



NAME
       _printf - produce formatted output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdarg.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function produces output according to a format. It is similar to the standard printf() function,
       but with a simplified implementation.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, _printf() returns the number of characters printed. If an error occurs, it returns -1.

BUGS
       This function does not support all the format specifiers provided by the standard printf() function. It only
       supports %c, %s, %d, %i, and %%.

       No length modifiers are supported for integer conversion specifiers (%d and %i). Furthermore, floating-point
       numbers (%f) and other data types are not supported.

EXAMPLES
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include "main.h"

       int main() {
           int count = _printf("Hello, %s! You have %d apples.\n", "Alice", 3);
           printf("Number of characters printed: %d\n", count);
           return 0;
       }

       Output:
       Hello, Alice! You have 3 apples.
       Number of characters printed: 31
